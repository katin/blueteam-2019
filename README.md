# blueteam-2019
Blue Team Event in Eugene, OR during DEFCON 2019

## Overview
Similar to a small-scale Joes-vs-Pros event, we set up two (minimum) blue teams that compete to keep their networks safe from the Red Team. The Gray team, if present, can be hunting flags and fun CTF-style puzzles on the machines in the network, complaining to the Blue Team if they canâ€™t get to a server or if a service goes down.

The Gold team manages the network simulation platform (ESXi, etc.) and operation of the Scoreboard/Scorebot.

## Event Length & Schedule
Due to the number of technical problems and the extent of setup and operation, two 8-hour consecutive days seems like a good length for the event. Optional party to follow on Sat evening.
